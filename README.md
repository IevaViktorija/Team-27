# Team-27 🚀

We are Team-27, comprising four talented members: 

### 👩‍💻 Teisi Timma 
I'm Estonian and working in aviation. I decided to apply to WoTech to improve my IT knowledge and skills.

### 👩‍💻 Kylli 
I`m from Estonia and working as project manager and CEO in CLT modular house factory called Aatomik Houses. I`m always wanted to study programming but life had somehow different plans for me. So I studied economy and marketing, create couple of companyes, had children etc. When I saw WoTech add, I thought that this is my last chance. Probably its too late for me to become an exellent programmer, but I really wanted to give myself an opportunity at least to try.


### 👩‍💻 LīgaC 
I currently work in radiotherapy in Riga. I joined WoTech to learn new skills, to meet new people and possibly change my workfield to IT. 

### 👩‍💻 Eve
A decade ago, I was a lawyer in Riga, but then my children were born and my legal career took a backseat. Now that the kids are big enough, I'm diving into my long-standing passion for software development and programming languages. I've joined this program to conquer bugs instead of briefs. Who knew that coding could be even more challenging than convincing a toddler to eat their veggies?
