# Team-27 🚀

We are Team-27, comprising four talented members: 

👩‍💻 ### Teisi Timma 
I'm Estonian and working in aviation. I decided to apply to WoTech to improve my IT knowledge and skills.

👩‍💻 ### Kylli 


👩‍💻 ### LīgaC 
I currently work in radiotherapy in Riga. I joined WoTech to learn new skills, to meet new people and possibly change my workfield to IT. 

👩‍💻 ### Eve
A decade ago, I was a lawyer in Riga, but then my children were born and my legal career took a backseat. Now that the kids are big enough, I'm diving into my long-standing passion for software development and programming languages. I've joined this program to conquer bugs instead of briefs. Who knew that coding could be even more challenging than convincing a toddler to eat their veggies?
