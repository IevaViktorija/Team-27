# Team-27 🚀

We are Team-27, and we have 4 members: 

### Teisi Timma 👩‍💻
I'm Estonian and working in aviation. I decided to apply to WoTech to improve my IT knowledge and skills.

### Kylli 👩‍💻


### LīgaC 👩‍💻
I currently work in radiotherapy in Riga. I joined WoTech to learn new skills, to meet new people and possibly change my workfield to IT. 

### Eve 👩‍💻
A decade ago, I was a lawyer in Riga, but then my children were born and my legal career took a backseat. Now that the kids are big enough, I'm diving into my long-standing passion for software development and programming languages. I've joined this program to conquer bugs instead of briefs. Who knew that coding could be even more challenging than convincing a toddler to eat their veggies?
